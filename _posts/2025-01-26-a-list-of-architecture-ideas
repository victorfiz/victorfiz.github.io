1. Dynamic Patching in CLIP
2. Short Term Memory via kv caching (Titans) -> PPO to train a model to find most important info
3. Improving exploration in GRPO... dynamic group querying... index on question space of high group disagreement -> currently there is only "relative" disagreement... Reward the PPO for finding high disagreement

Train a policy that learns the most effective knowledge distillation into a small model: try to overfit the small model as rapidly as possible
