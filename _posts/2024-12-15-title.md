title: The Blessings of Dimensionality
subtitle: High dimensional space is often said to be cursed. It has some unintuitive properties that complicates the extraction of meaningful information in traditional machine learning. Looking a bit closer, it turns out that this is actually a blessing in disguise. The geometry of these spaces are actually very effective at forming distinct regions that describe the hierarchical generative processes at the heart of problems in deep learning.

Understanding spaces in high dimensions is surprisingly unintuitive. A simple example that illustrates this is scaling a sphere to infinite dimensions, where its volume tends to zero. 

Let's show this mathematically. The volume of a sphere is given by:

$$
V_n(r) = \frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2 + 1)} r^n
$$

<details>
<summary>Unfortunately it's a little difficult to develop an intuition around this formula. Nonetheless, here is the proof of the volume tending to zero.</summary>


$$
V_n(1)
\,=\,
\frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma\!\Bigl(\frac{n}{2}+1\Bigr)}
\;\overset{\text{Stirling}}{\sim}\;
\frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{
  \sqrt{\pi n}\,\Bigl(\tfrac{n}{2e}\Bigr)^{\frac{n}{2}}
}
\;=\;
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n}}
\left(\frac{2e\pi}{n}\right)^{\!\tfrac{n}{2}}
\;\xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{}\;0.
$$

<small>To simplify notation, this considers a unit sphere, $r=1$.</small>

A nicer way to visualise this is to think of a hypersphere as a stack of discs in a lower dimension.

</div>

Consider an $(n+1)$-hypersphere made up of $n$-dimensional disks with radius $r(x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}$ and thickness $dx$. Its volume is 

$$
V_{n+1} = \int_{-1}^{1} V_n r(x)^n dx
$$

$$
= V_n \int_{-1}^{1} \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)^n dx
$$


<details>
<summary>If you're still wondering where that gamma function came from...</summary>

$$
V_{n+1} = V_n \int_{0}^{1} t^{-\frac{1}{2}} (1 - t)^{\frac{n}{2}} \, dt
$$

$$
= V_n \text{Beta}\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{n+2}{2}\right)
$$

$$
= V_n \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{n+2}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+3}{2}\right)}
$$

$$
V_{n+1} = \frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\cancel{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}} \cdot \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \cancel{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+2}{2}\right)}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+3}{2}\right)}
$$

<small>
$$
\scriptstyle{\text{where } \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}}
$$
</small>

$$
= \frac{\pi^{(n+1)/2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{(n+1)}{2}+1\right)}
$$


<small>Notice that we again assumed a unit sphere. You can show that this generalises by considering $\int_{-r}^{r} \left( \sqrt{r - x^2} \right)^n dx$ and using a nice substitution. Good luck!</small>

Now we can see more clearly, that the dimensionality scales up a decaying function $r(x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}$, which represents the radius of a hypersphere sitting in $n-1$. As we increase $n$, this function spikes and collapses to zero area as $n \rightarrow \infty$. $\square$

Things get weirder still..
</summary>
If we plot $\frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2 + 1)} r^n$, we see that the volume maximises around $n=5$, before dropping to zero.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

</div>

As far as I can tell, this maximum is arbitrary and has no practical implications.

</div>

Another interesting behaviour is that $r(x)$ gets squeezed around $x=0$, and all area disapears from its tails. When $x=0$, the radius is $r(0) = 1$ at its maximum – this is when the $n-1$ space contributes most of its volume the $n$ space. 

So, in high dimensions the density is highest around the outer shell of the hypersphere. This has important implication in machine learning, known as the curse of dimensionality.
